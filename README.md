## Visual Studio Extension  
Visual Studio extension for developers to share code snippet quickly with their peers without having to switch out of the IDE.  

### Why is this better?   
Because this has no character limits or indentation errors on sharing code snippets, it is the quickest way to share code snippet within Visual studio IDE, is time-efficient, takes no effort & there is no need switching between applications

This extension was created as a part of Microsoft Apps Hackthon 19. This repo contains just a fraction of the implemented idea.   
PS. Being a Hackathon project, the code is not well documented :p
